NARB Venues dataset
=============================

For now all this repo contains is a data set containing 970 art 'venues' that were collected in 2009/2010 as part of the NARB.ME art discovery project which consisted of both a website and an iPhone app that allowed people to discover nearby art venues in, mostly, the netherlands.

Each record contains the following fields:

 * uuid	– unique id as used in narb app
 * name	– venue name
 * description – venue description
 * tel – venue telephone number
 * email – venue contact email
 * url – venue URL
 * address – venue street address
 * city – venue city
 * zipcode – venue zipcode
 * country_code – venue country code (two letter)
 * country – venue country name
 * latitude – latitude for venue address
 * longitude – longitude for venue address
 * opening_hours – venue opening hours
 * foursquare_vid – the foursquare id of this venue if available
 * last_updated – when this info was last updated

*while perhaps interesting as a data set for experimentation and learning this data is incomplete, out of date and probably wrong so use at your own risk*
